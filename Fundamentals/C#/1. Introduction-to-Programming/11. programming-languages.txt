Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#? Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages 
along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

The 6 most popular computer languages according to Google Search Results are: C, Java, C++, C#, Visual Basic and PHP. 

C is developed by Denis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. It is one of the most used languages. Many other languages (Java, PHP, C#, JavaScript) use different elements that have been initiated in C.

Java is one of the most popular languages that is used. The language is class-based oriented and is designed to have as few as implementation dependencies as possible. It derives much of its syntax from C and C++.

C++ is object-oriented computer language. It is designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. It is useful for desktop applications, video games and servers.

Visual Basic is released in 1991 by Microsoft. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use. It is an  integrated development environment (IDE).

PHP is a language for web developing. It is widely used. Rasmus Lerdrorf (1994) is the developer of the language. 

Differences between C# and the other languages

C is an older programming language that is not object oriented – you need to tell the program to do everything. C# is fully oriented.

Open JDK is one of the major implementation of Java. Visual C#, .NET Framework, Mono and DotGNU are the major implementations of C#.

In C++, classes and structs are virtually identical whereas in C#, they are quite different. C# classes can implement any number of interfaces, but can inherit from only one base class. Furthermore, C# structs do not support inheritance, and do not support explicit default constructors (one is provided by default).

Though C# and Visual Basic are syntactically very different, that is where the differences mostly end. Their differences are primarily syntactic.

C# is a programming language as PHP is, but with the difference that C# targets a platform (.NET) that also accepts other languages, including PHP.

Similarities between C# and the other languages

C# and Objective C have a class library.

Both C# and Java are Type-Safe Languages

C# inherits most of its operators, keywords, and statements directly from C++.

VB and C# have converged over there life time as useful syntax features have been incorporated from each. 

C# and PHP has multiple projects.
