Problem 9.Pros and Cons of Using Indexes in a Database?

What is index?
An index is a data structure that stores the values of a column in a table. 

What indexing methods exist? 
Two methods: non-clustered and clustered.

What is clustered index? 
Clustered index ensure that the table rows are stored in order based on their key values.

What is B-Tree? 
It is a tree structure, an algorithm, which keeps data records allowing searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions.

What is column-store index? 
It is method that uses columnar arrangement to store, retrieve and manage a data.

What is full-text search index? 
It allows searching to a document in a text database.

What is spatial index? 
It is an index that allows indexing a spatial column, a spatial data type, such as 3D objects, geometry, topological analyses and linear networks.

What are the pros and cons of using indexes?
Pros: the structure allows for quickly accessing to specific information.
Cons: increase the disk space requirements of the database, slow down the process of inserting, updating or deleting data.
