Problem 8.Database Integrity Constraints

Integrity constraints guarantee integrity, consistency and relationship in a database system. 

There are several types of integrity constraints:

a) Entity constraints, regarding the primary key:
- ensure that there is one unique value per table;
- ensure that there are no null values.

b) Referential constraints, regarding the foreign key:
- ensure that the foreign key value is referenced to the primary key value;
- ensure that you cannot delete a primary key value if it is already related to a foreign key value.

c) Domain constraints:
- ensure that all columns have a value;
- there are used upon creating a domain.

d) User-defined constraints: 
- referees to the user set of constraints.
