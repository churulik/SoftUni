Problem 6. Schema Normalization

The database normalization is a process which decreases repeating data attributes in a table. The repeated data is distributed among several tables. The idea is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table.

For example: 

Table: AirTickets
TicketId, From, To, Company, AirPlaneNumber, ByFromCompany, LuggageInfo Price
1023, Sofia, London, AirBulgaria, 777, Orbitz, 1 checked-in, 200
1024, Paris, Moscow, AirFrance, 457, Orbitz, 1 checked-in, 320
1025, Berlin, New York, Luftahse, 563, Lufhanse, 2 checked-in, 800
1026, Varna, Moscow, AirBulgaria, 770, Orbitz, 1 checked-in, 400

We can create several tables to normalize the table:

Table: Company 
Id, name
1. AirBulgaria
2. Luftahse,
3. AirFrance

Table: ByFromCompany
Id, name
1. Orbitz
2. Lufthanse
3. Airbulgaria

Table: LuggageInfo
1. 1 checked-in
2. 2 checked-in

TicketId, From, To, Company, AirPlaneNumber, ByFromCompany, LuggageInfo Price
1023, Sofia, London, 1, 777, 1, 1, 200
1024, Paris, Moscow, 2, 457, 1, 1, 320
1025, Berlin, New York, 3, 563, 2, 2, 800
1026, Varna, Moscow, 1, 770, 1, 1, 400

If some company change its luggage policy, we can change the data only in one table.

Problem 7. Advantages of Normalized Databases

The benefits are (source - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/283878):

Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.
Create a separate table for each set of related data.
Identify each set of related data with a primary key.
Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records.
Relate these tables with a foreign key.
Eliminate fields that do not depend on the key.
